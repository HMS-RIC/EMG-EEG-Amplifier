# EMG-EEG-Amplifier
3 Channel instrumentation amplifier circuit using AD8221. 

#EMG: 1 channel, fully differential. 10Hz highpass and 100x gain. 

#EEG 2 channels use a common reference. .5Hz highpass and 100x gain.

Gain is set using a single 499 Ohm resistor per channel. 
Input bandwidth is set by RC network.

Black wire: GND
Red wire: +5V
White wire: -5V
Blue wires (3): Outputs
